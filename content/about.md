I'm a data analyst/scientist with a special interest in exploratory data analysis, computer vision and ML security. Currently working as a Data Analyst at Brainly.

In my spare time I grow plants, play video games, renovate old furniture and keep trying to learn how to play the piano. I might have a slight addiction to green tea.
