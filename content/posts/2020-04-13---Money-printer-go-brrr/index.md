As you may or may not have realized by now, I am an avid memer. Recently one of my favourites is the [Money Printer Go Brrr meme](https://knowyourmeme.com/memes/money-printer-go-brrr) that's so well-fitting given the current state of affairs. I also came across a modification that I've enjoyed even more:

![There are two people in this image, a Zoomer Wojak (with the Java logo) and a Boomer Wojak (with the Python logo). The Zoomer Wojak says, 'noooo!!! you have to write your own code! you cannot just use a library that does everything for you!!' and the Boomer Wojak replies with 'haha from python.goes import brrr'](files/meme.jpg "Money printer go brrr")

Thus, the [moneyprintergobrr pip package](https://pypi.org/project/moneyprintergobrrr/) was born.

__Installation:__

`pip install moneyprintergobrr`

__Usage:__

```
from moneyprinter.moneyprinter import MoneyPrinter

MoneyPrinter().go() ## prints out 'brrr'
```

__Actual usage:__

Use it instead of printing out whatever you usually use for debugging.
